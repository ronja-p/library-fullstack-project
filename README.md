## Overview

The frontend was made in React and utilised many Material-UI components.

The backend runs on an Express server and is connected to a MongoDB database. There are APIs for Users, Books, and Authors.

There is a robust user management and admin system. Users can view book data and author data as well as borrowing the books. Admins can make CRUD operations on books and authors.
